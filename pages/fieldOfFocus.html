			Use A & D to move the student.<br/>

			This game represents a students attempt at multitasking in class.
			The green objects represent positive tasks for them to complete, while the red represent distractions.
			After each level, the player is given a grade for each class they participated in where green objects add to their grade and red objects subtract from it.
			On the third stage, if the player fails to respond to the phone messages correctly three times they will be kicked from class and receive a game over.
