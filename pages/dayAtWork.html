			<p>Use the mouse to flick the ball of paper across your office. <br />
			<br />
			This simulates a single working day in an office environment. 
			The player is supposed to flick the paper ball across the office in order to reach the briefcase of work on the other side. 
			Along the way the player can run into distractions that act as mini games that need to be completed. 
			During the game, an eight hour timer is running in the top corner. 
			However, this timer counts down significantly faster while inside a distraction. 
			After reaching the end, the player is told how much of their day they wasted before beginning their work.
