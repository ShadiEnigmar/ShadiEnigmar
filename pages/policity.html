			Policity, a mobile phone game, demonstrates the complexity of decision-making pertaining to our world. In this app, players must swipe across the screen to view different areas of a city while looking for glowing objects. The glowing objects can be clicked on, which leads to a question regarding the city. Players answer the question, which impacts the world slightly. Overtime, these slight changes add up to produce an entirely different looking world by the end of the game.<br />
