			Mockup video game cover designed based on a study of major trends in the gaming industry.
			The study discovered that competitive online multiplayer games remained popular other the longest periods of time.
			Conquest acts as a combination of the Battle Royale and MOBA genres, the two most popular competitive game genres at the time.
			The game took loot collecting and large player counts from Battle Royals and combined it with teamplay centered around objectives and base defense taken from MOBAs.
			The cover also aims to imitate that of popular games. With the main, mascot character striking a pose on the front in an environment from the game.
