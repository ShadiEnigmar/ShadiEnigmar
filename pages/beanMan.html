			<p>Animation of a &quot;Bean Man&#039;s&quot; long trip to work. <br />
			<br />
			Bean Man was created to highlight the monotony of everyday working life. The slow motions of the main character contrast against the quick movements of the camera. This highlights the reluctance in his actions as going to work is often dreaded.<br />

			Created Spring 2019 in Adobe Animate.</p>
