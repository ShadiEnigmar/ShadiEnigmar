			<p>Animation of a &quot;Bean Man&#039;s&quot; long trip to work. <br />
			<br />
			Bean Man was created to highlight the monotony of everyday working life. 
			The slow motions of the main character contrast against the quick movements of the camera. 
			This highlights the reluctance in his actions as he drags himself to work.
			At the end, the viewer can discover that the main character is working to produce this very animation.
