			<p>
			This image showcases a drinking bird toy who has been placed inside a cage. 
			This toy is designed to "drink" forever. 
			Because this bird is destined to repeat the same task over and over again, he will never learn and will be trapped at this point in life forever.
			The image was then animated to better showcase the effect.
