			<p>
			Series of font posters. Posters get more abstract as they go.<br />
			<br />
			The first poster is meant to showcase the distinctive aspects of the font Fertigo Pro. 
			This font was created in 2004 by Jos Buivenga. 
			The lowercase f, being both the first letter in Fertigo and the most unique letter of the typeface, is displayed largely across the poster. 
			The layout as a whole was designed to follow a strict, grid structure.
			<br /><br />
			The other two posters feature the font Akronim by Grzegorz Klimczewski.
			As this font is much abstract, these posters followed a more postmodern approach to design.
			The first Akronim poster aimed to recreate the fonts flowing nature through leaves draped down a wall. 
			<br />
            The second emphasized the broken nature of the letters. 
            Each letter in Akronim is created with several completely separate lines. 
			These lines were turned into holes in what is supposed to look like paper that has been cut up and scattered.
