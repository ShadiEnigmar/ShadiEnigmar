			<p>Blender animation showcasing a bull&#039;s long journey to a new life.<br />
			<br />
			The Journey West aims to compare the trip along the Oregon Trail with the harsh reality of everyday life. 
			It does this by telling the tale of a lone bull who&rsquo;s only job was to pull a wagon westward. 
			He travels through many different harsh environments till finally reaching the destination. 
			At the end, when the bull finally believes he is given a chance to rest and enjoy his new, &ldquo;better&rdquo; life on the west coast, the bull is killed. 
			He has now served his purpose and is now only useful as food. 
			This small look into the bull&rsquo;s life aims to parallel a depressed take on life itself. 
			Travelling along a monotonous journey only to be rewarded with death at the end. 
			The way the bull&#039;s head remains fixed in the center aims to show a lack of emotion and responsiveness. 
			Similar to someone who is merely coasting through life, hoping it will get better, yet never putting in the effort to bring about the change themselves.<br />
