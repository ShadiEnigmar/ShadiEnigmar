			As this project is a work in progress, it is not yet fully documented. However, assets can be viewed in the <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wGzui3qwVqoBn5vw0fMOmNJa2UnxyDab?usp=sharing">google drive folder here</a>.
			
			This game is a prototype for a game I will be making for my senior thesis project. 
			The gameplay will be that of an action adventure, metroidvania type game.
			It is set in a world created from the main characters imagination. 
			They have recently moved to a new town, and have created this fantasy interpretation to help them escape from, and transition to, their new life.
