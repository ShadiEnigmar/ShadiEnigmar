			This game acts as a prototype for a game I will be making for my senior thesis project. 
			The gameplay will be that of an action adventure, metroidvania type game.
			It is set in a world created from the main characters imagination. 
			They have recently moved to a new town, and have created this fantasy interpretation to help them escape from—and transition to—their new life.
