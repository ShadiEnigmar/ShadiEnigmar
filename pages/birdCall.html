			Use the arrow keys to move the player and space to interact with a bird or a hole in the tree.<br />
			<br />

			The player in this game, Robin, is about to graduate from high school and is going around asking friends and family about what she should do afterwards.
			The other birds all give their own thoughts and opinions about the different possibilities ahead of her. She also stops to peer out though hole in the tree through which she can see people conversing.
			She does not understand their words or actions, but she enjoys the sounds they produce. This is parallel to how humans enjoy bird songs even though we cannot understand the messages.

			Below you can find a compilation of the sprite sheets used for the animations.
